# pythonTextEditor
A simple text editor program made in Python, the ui is done using tkinter.

To use, the file must be run with a Python interpretor, like IDLE.
Once run, the user is presented with a UI with two options, Open and Save, as well as a large text area.
The user can write in the text area, then when they are finished, can save the file with the save button. 
Conversely, the user can use the open button to open an already created text file.
